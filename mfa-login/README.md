## Relevant Information:

Multi-factor authentication is a way to improve product security by adding an extra layer of security by requiring users
to provide a second form of authentication in addition to a username and password. Here we will use TOTP (Time-based
One-Time Password) as the second form of identification. This TOTP Generated by an application on the user's mobile
device, such as Google Authenticator.
